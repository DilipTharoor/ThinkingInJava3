/**
 * This class is an example of using a service provider framework interface with a JDBC driver.
 *
 * Using Postgres as the database.
 * Install postgres latest version.
 *
 * After installing a postgres user is created in the system, but we can't/shouldn't use this user for our activities.
 * This is just a default user, just like sa in mysql.
 *
 * Create a super user with a username in postgres, since it is not correct to create password for postgres user
 * for security reasons
 *
 * Once the superuser is created in postgres, connect to the new user from the root console and connect to postgres using
 * the command 'psql <the db name>'
